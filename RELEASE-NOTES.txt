Running
=======

    Standalone
    ----------

    To run Hightide, simply change to the top level of the unzipped distribution and type:

    java -jar start.jar

    Surf to http://localhost:8080. If you have been successful, you will see a welcome
    page containing information about this product.



    Using the maven-hightide-plugin
    -------------------------------
    mvn hightide:run
    mvn hightide:run-war
    mvn hightide:run-exploded

    Hightide provides a Maven plugin for quickly and easily testing your
    web applications. This plugin works similarly to the Jetty maven plugin
    (see http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JETTY/Maven+Jetty+Plugin for more
    information).

    The Hightide plugin provides full, out-of-the-box support for all
    features of the standalone server, such as JTA, JMS, JNDI, JDBC. 
    As with Hightide standalone, the ActiveMQ, Atomikos and Derby 
    jars are automatically on the classpath when the plugin is run.
    
    If you want to use a different JTA implementation, then you can 
    configure it by using the <transaction> element in the plugin's 
    <configuration> in your pom.xml.

    For an example of configuring the plugin, look at 
    $hightide.home/examples/auctiondemo/pom.xml.

    If you have a webapp built by maven2, you can declare this module as a 
    dependency of your webapp, to 	include all the J2EE APIs when building 
    your project.
    
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.mortbay.hightide</groupId>
      <artifactId>hightide-provided-apis</artifactId>
      <version>6.1H-SNAPSHOT</version>
      <type>pom</type>
      <scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>

    Hightide Dependencies

    These module lists all the dependencies run by Hightide including 
    ActiveMQ, Atomikos, Derby, SLF4J, Joda-time, etc...
